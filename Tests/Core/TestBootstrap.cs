// NOTE: Bootstrap classes have been moved to DMotion.Runtime.
// See DMotion.Authoring.DMotionBakingBootstrapUnified and DMotionRuntimeBootstrap.
// 
// If you have samples imported that also have a bootstrap (e.g. LatiosBootstrap),
// you may see a "Multiple custom ICustomBootstrap" warning. This is harmless -
// Unity will use one of them (they do the same thing).

namespace DMotion.Tests
{
    // This file is kept for backwards compatibility and documentation.
    // All bootstrap functionality is now in Runtime/Authoring/DMotionBootstrap.cs
}
